    "steps": [
      "paginate: Loop while there's a cursor. Fetch a page, yield each item, then advance the cursor.",
      "collect: Use for-await-of to drain an async iterable into an array.",
      "asyncMap: for-await over the input, apply the transform fn, yield the result.",
      "Laziness is automatic — the generator pauses at each yield until .next() is called."
