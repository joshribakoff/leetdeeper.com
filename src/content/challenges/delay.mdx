# Delay

Write a function that returns a Promise which resolves after a given number of milliseconds.

## Signature

```ts
function delay(ms: number): Promise<void>
```

## Constraints

- The returned Promise must resolve with `undefined`
- Must wait at least `ms` milliseconds before resolving

## Hint

Look into `setTimeout` and how to wrap callback-based APIs with `new Promise()`.
