# Fetch with Retry

Write a function that calls an async operation and retries on failure, up to a maximum number of attempts.

## Signature

```ts
function fetchWithRetry<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, retries: number): Promise<T>
```

## Behavior

- Call `fn()`. If it resolves, return the result.
- If it rejects, retry — up to `retries` total attempts.
- If all attempts fail, throw the last error.

## Hint

Think about a loop that catches errors and decrements a counter.
