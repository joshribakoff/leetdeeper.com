# Promise.all

Implement `Promise.all` from scratch.

## Signature

```ts
function promiseAll<T>(promises: Promise<T>[]): Promise<T[]>
```

## Behavior

- Takes an array of Promises
- Resolves with an array of results, **preserving order**
- If any Promise rejects, reject with that error immediately
- An empty array should resolve with `[]`

## Hint

You'll need to track how many promises have resolved and where each result belongs.
