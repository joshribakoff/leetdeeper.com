# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices** of the two numbers that add up to `target`.

## Constraints

- Each input has **exactly one solution**
- You may not use the same element twice
- Return the answer in any order

## Examples

| Input | Target | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `[2, 7, 11, 15]` | `9` | `[0, 1]` |
| `[3, 2, 4]` | `6` | `[1, 2]` |
| `[3, 3]` | `6` | `[0, 1]` |

## Hint

Think about what complement you need for each number, and how to look it up in O(1).
